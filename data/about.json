  "bio": "I'm all about diving into new tech and building everything from scratch. Whether it's tinkering with Rust for high-performance coding or delving into cybersecurity in my spare time, I'm always up for a challenge. I love the thrill of game Dev and the satisfaction of crafting robust solutions in full-stack projects. With a passion for pushing boundaries and a never-ending curiosity, I'm on a mission to explore, learn, and create awesome things in the tech world. Ps I also self-host all of my tools.",
