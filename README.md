Simple portfolio template built with React with backend ready to go for any advanced cloud deployment strategies.

Data is read from `client/src/data` folder and rendered on the website.

**The backend is not required to use this template.**

The backend is there so that in the future if any server-sided functionality (a personal blog maybe?) is required, you can use it.
